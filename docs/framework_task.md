# Python Test Automation Framework Task

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements and expectations for implementing a Python-based test automation framework. The primary focus is on creating a well-structured, maintainable, and scalable framework that demonstrates professional software engineering practices.

## Key Requirements

### 1. Framework Structure
- Implement a clear and logical project structure
- Follow Python best practices and PEP 8 guidelines
- Include proper separation of concerns
- Implement page object model (POM) design pattern
- Include configuration management
- Implement logging and reporting mechanisms

### 2. Core Components
- Test runner integration (pytest)
- WebDriver management
- Page objects
- Test data management
- Utilities and helpers
- Configuration management
- Reporting system

### 3. Project Organization
```
project_root/
├── config/
│   ├── config.yaml
│   └── environment.py
├── pages/
│   ├── base_page.py
│   └── [feature]_page.py
├── tests/
│   ├── conftest.py
│   └── test_[feature].py
├── utils/
│   ├── driver_factory.py
│   └── helpers.py
├── reports/
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

### 4. Technical Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Selenium WebDriver
- pytest
- pytest-html (for reporting)
- pytest-xdist (for parallel execution)
- Allure-pytest (for detailed reporting)
- Logging framework

### 5. Framework Features
- Cross-browser testing support
- Parallel test execution
- Screenshot capture on failure
- Detailed HTML reports
- Allure reports integration
- Configurable test data
- Environment-specific configurations

### 6. Code Quality
- Type hints
- Docstrings
- Code comments
- Consistent naming conventions
- Modular and reusable code
- Clean code principles

### 7. Documentation
- Setup instructions
- Framework architecture
- Adding new tests guide
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting guide

## Evaluation Criteria
1. Code organization and structure
2. Implementation of design patterns
3. Code quality and maintainability
4. Documentation quality
5. Framework extensibility
6. Test execution efficiency
7. Reporting capabilities

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Create virtual environment
3. Install dependencies
4. Configure environment variables
5. Run sample tests

## Adding New Tests
1. Create page objects in `pages/` directory
2. Add test data in `config/` directory
3. Create test file in `tests/` directory
4. Implement test methods using pytest fixtures
5. Add test documentation

## Best Practices
- Use meaningful test names
- Implement proper assertions
- Handle test data properly
- Use appropriate waits
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow DRY principle
- Use meaningful commit messages

## Reporting
- HTML reports for quick overview
- Allure reports for detailed analysis
- Screenshots for failed tests
- Log files for debugging
- Test execution statistics

## Maintenance
- Regular dependency updates
- Code review process
- Documentation updates
- Performance optimization
- Bug fixes and improvements
